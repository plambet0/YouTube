To start the project you need to go to https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31/ 
You can login with many options there. Then you have to subscribe to the free subscription. After that you have to copy the 'X-RapidAPI-Key' code and replace it with 'process.env.REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY' in fetchFromAPI.jsx file. Now you can fetch all the data from the YouTube API.
